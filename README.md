# Building a Weekly Planner App - A Hackathon Project

In this blog post, we will explore the process of building a Weekly Planner app during a hackathon. The app aims to provide users with an organized and efficient way to manage their weekly tasks. We will discuss the file structure, frontend and backend components, and the key features of the app.

## File Structure

Here is the file structure of the Weekly Planner app:

code
```
client
  |- public
  |- src
      |- components
        |- ...
      |- pages
        |- ...
      App.jsx
      index.js
-server
  |- apiRoutes.js
  |- models.js
  |- server.js
```

The client folder contains the frontend components and pages, while the server folder contains the backend files responsible for handling API routes and data models.

## Frontend Components

The frontend of the app is built using React.js and follows a component-based architecture. Here are some of the key components:

- `NavBar`: Renders the navigation bar at the top of the app, allowing users to navigate between different sections.
- `HomePage`: Serves as the landing page of the app, providing an overview of its features and enticing users to explore further.
- `DaysPage`: Displays the tasks for each day of the week, allowing users to view, add, and manage their weekly schedule.
- `Timer`: Provides a timer feature that users can utilize for time tracking or setting reminders.
- `AddPage`: Dynamically renders based on the selected day, enabling users to add tasks for specific days of the week.

## Backend Components

The backend of the app is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing the necessary API routes and data models. The key backend components include:

- `apiRoutes.js`: Defines the API routes for adding and retrieving tasks for different days of the week.
- `models.js`: Contains the data models for tasks, including Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and so on.
- `server.js`: Sets up the Express server and connects it to the database.

## Key Features of the Weekly Planner App

The Weekly Planner app offers several key features that enhance task management and productivity:

1. Navigation and Homepage: Users can easily navigate between different sections of the app using the navigation bar. The homepage provides an overview of the app's features and serves as a starting point for users.

2. Weekly Planner: The app's main functionality lies in the Weekly Planner page. Users can view their existing tasks, add new tasks, and manage their weekly schedule. Tasks are organized by day, providing a clear overview of the week.

3. Task Management: The `AddPage` component allows users to add tasks for specific days of the week. This feature dynamically renders based on the selected day, enabling users to enter task details and save them accordingly.

4. Timer Functionality: The `Timer` component provides a timer feature that users can utilize for time tracking or setting reminders. This feature enhances productivity by allowing users to allocate specific time intervals for their tasks.

5. User Authentication: The `LoginPage` component offers secure login functionality, ensuring that only authorized users can access their personalized weekly planner. User authentication adds a layer of privacy and data protection.

By combining these key features, the Weekly Planner app provides users with a comprehensive tool to organize their tasks, manage their time effectively, and maintain a structured weekly schedule.

## Conclusion

Building a Weekly Planner app during a hackathon demonstrates the power of combining frontend and backend technologies to create a user-friendly and functional application. By understanding the file structure, frontend and backend components, and key features of the app, developers can create similar applications to help users streamline their task management and boost productivity. So why not give it a try and build your own Weekly Planner app? Happy coding!
